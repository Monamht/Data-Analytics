# Data-Analytics
This repository contains a cleaned and preprocessed version of the Netflix dataset. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing text fields, converting date formats to a consistent style, renaming columns for uniformity, and fixing data types. The cleaned data is ready for analysis and modeling.
